 *  \brief Class representing an instant of time

 *  calendar and a given time. This class is extremely simple and does not
 *  take into account leap seconds. The class can be used to calculate the
 *  Julian calendar date required to derive the sun position.
 *
 *  Everything in this class is assumed UTC
